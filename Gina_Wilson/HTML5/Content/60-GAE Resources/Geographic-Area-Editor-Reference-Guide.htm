                                        <p>In WFDSS, there are system-wide user roles (e.g., Author, Viewer) and incident-specific privileges (e.g., Owner, Editor, Reviewer, Approver). Incident privileges are specific to each incident.</p>

                                        <p>Geographic Editors and Administrators can view role requests from the Administration tab. Role requests include requests for new WFDSS accounts as well as additional user roles. The Show Role Request table provides Geographic Editors a list of users within their current Geographic Area (see Home &gt; Contact Information to verify your current GA). Administrators see all role requests in the system.</p>
                                        <p>To view role requests:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li value="1">

                                                <p>Click Show Role Request. The table displays the role requests available to you.</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li value="3">

                                        <h3>Granting User Role Requests</h3>
                                        <p>Geographic Editors and Administrators can grant user roles. Users are usually granted the Viewer role when they request access to the application. If users are not federal employees, they are not automatically granted Viewer role. The Geographic Editor or Administrator must confirm that nonfederal users require access and have completed annual security training. The users are required to request user roles that allow them to complete their assigned tasks. For example:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>Run fire behavior analyses (Fire Behavior Specialist Role)</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>Own incidents (Author Role)</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p> Edit decision documents (Author Role)</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>Pre-load strategic objectives, management requirements, and unit shapes (Data Manager Role)</p>
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <p>Geographic Editors can only grant or edit the following user roles: Viewer, Dispatcher, Author, Fire Behavior Specialist and Data Manager. They can also Disable Users. Administrators can grant all user roles.</p>
                                        <p>A user's roles can be different for Production and Training. Roles granted to a user in Production are mirrored to Training. Conversely, roles granted to a user in Training are not mirrored to Production.</p>
                                        <h3>Editing User Roles</h3>
                                        <p>A User Role might need to be edited for the following reasons:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>User requires different user roles due to a job change.</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>User needs to be disabled in the application due to retirement or otherwise leaving employment.</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>User requires a Geographic editor role (only Administrators can grant this role).</p>

                                            <li>

                                            <li>
                                                <p>User needs to upload shape files to incidents in their geographic area. Shape Privileges by User Role further discusses the Editors role in relation to shapes.</p>
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>Administrators and Geographic Area Editors manage notification lists from the Administration tab. Geographic Editors have access only to the Geographic Area Summary and the Fire Behavior Requests. Administrators and GA Editors can review user accounts to determine those accounts that have not been accessed in a specified number of days. The user has the option of exporting the Notification Lists to an Excel spreadsheet.</p>
                                        <p>There are notification lists for:</p>

                                        <h2>Monitoring Fire Behavior Request Notifications</h2>
                                        <p>The National Fire Decision Support Center no longer monitors Fire Behavior Request notifications. Geographic Area Editors are responsible for managing the coordination of all Fire Behavior Requests generated by WFDSS users.</p>
                                        <p>The National Fire Decision Support Center will manually subscribe new Geographic Area Editor’s agency email to the Fire Behavior Request notifications for the geo-area listed in their profile when the Geographic Area Editor role is first assigned. GA Editors will need to adjust their notifications and contact information if they want to receive other geo-area notifications in addition to the one listed in their profile and/or if they would like to receive the notifications to alternative emails or phone numbers (i.e. text messages). Geographic Area Editors can subscribe/unsubscribe other WFDSS users to the notifications as needed for coverage of Fire Behavior Requests. </p>
                                        <p>Geographic Area Editors needing assistance filling Fire Behavior Requests should contact the National Fire Decision Support On-Call Coordinator: 208-387-5253.</p>

                                        <h2>Analyses Related Tasks for Geographic Area Editors
<br /></h2>
                                        <p>Geographic Area Editors (and Incident Owners, Editors or Dispatchers) can generate WFDSS Automated 
Basic and STFB Fire Behavior for incidents in their geographic area. In addition, they can draw, 
manipulate, or upload analysis-related shapes such as analysis ignitions, landscape masks, and barriers.
Since fire managers contact the local GA editors when fire behavior analysis is needed for an incident, it 
is imperative that a GA Editor become familiar with the analysis skills with the GA area, and with the list 
of WFDSS users that have fire behavior specialist or super analyst roles.
The USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) currently houses the multiple 
processing machines that run FSPro. Processing capability has increased substantially and continues to 
do so, and prioritizing runs is no longer necessary most of the time.</p>
                                        <h2>Litigation</h2>
                                        <p>When Geographic Area Editors become aware of a litigation which involves analysis of fires using WFDSS, the following should be considered:</p>
                                        <p>• Analyses of fires for litigation should occur on Production only, under the original incident, and should be created on Training. Analyses in Training are regularly purged from the system, making this an inappropriate place for the preservation of legal materials.</p>
                                        <p>• Alert WFDSS business leads if you become aware of analysis for an active wildfire on federal lands that is occurring on Training. That needs to be on Production.</p>
                                        <p>• Encourage commonsensical naming convention for litigation efforts, such as “litigation” in the run names with the appropriate fire name. Analysis should NOT be run under a fake fire name, or otherwise named to obscure its intent.</p>
